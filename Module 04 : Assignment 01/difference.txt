Answer: The difference between list and dictionary are:
    List:
        i) list is a comma separated item inside [ ] bracket.
        ii) list may have mixed data like string, integer, tuple, dictionary, list etc.
        iii) list is a mutable data structure
        iv) list have index. To access list we may use index inside[], like list_name[index] = assigning_value
        v) list support add, remove, insert any position etc operation.
    Dictionary:
        i) Dictionary is a pair type item.  The first item of pair is called key and second value is value
        ii) The key of dictionary will be unique like 'name', 'age' etc.
        iii) Dictionary has not index.  To access dictionary we can use key inside bracket[]. Example dictionary_name[key] = value
        iv) dictionary support insert, remove etc operations.
